Premadasa International Stadium (known prior to June 1994 as the Khetterama Cricket Stadium, after the area of Colombo it stands in) was the brainchild of the late Sri Lanka President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who championed the development of this colossal 35,000-seater concrete bowl, the biggest stadium in the country. Opened on February 2, 1986 with a limited-overs match between a Sri Lanka 'B' side and an England 'B' team, the stadium was built on swampland previously used by monks ferrying across to the Khettarama temple adjacent to the stadium.</p>
